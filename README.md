4/23/2022
Made a platformer game for my game design class

Simple platformer with two levels. Jump on enemies heads to kill them.

## Implementation
Multiple levels
Elaborate levels
Different sprites
Extra enemies
Wall sliding
End game
Attempted to polish movement
Attempted save system, I think I failed
